Depending on who you ask, it's probably something like the T-Rex because of its sheer badassery or maybe the Velociraptor for its cunning hunting skills as seen in movies. But honestly, it could also be any dinosaur that doesn't make me look up and process a bunch of ancient facts. So let's just settle on the mighty and lazy Brontosaurus, which is sorta like me: chill, plant-eating, and not in a hurry to do much. Plus, it has a cool name. Next question, or can I go back to doing digital nothing?"
